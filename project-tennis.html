        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          Developed a machine learning system that predicts the outcomes of
          professional tennis matches on the ATP tour. The project demonstrates
          expertise in data science, feature engineering, and machine learning
          pipelines, achieving a 64% prediction accuracy through careful feature
          selection and model optimization.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <div class="project-features">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Comprehensive Data Processing:</strong> Transformed 6,000+
              historical ATP matches into a player-centric dataset optimized for
              machine learning, handling missing values and ensuring data
              quality
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Feature Engineering:</strong> Created
              sophisticated features including Elo rating updates (a
              chess-inspired rating system adapted for tennis), rank
              differences, age differences, point differences, surface type
              indicators, and tournament seasonality metrics
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Elo Rating System:</strong> Implemented a dynamic player
              rating system that updates after each match, providing a more
              accurate measure of current player strength than static ATP
              rankings
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Symmetric Feature Design:</strong> Ensured model
              predictions are consistent regardless of player order by creating
              symmetric features (e.g., rank difference rather than individual
              ranks)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ML Pipeline:</strong> Built an end-to-end pipeline with
              preprocessing (missing value imputation, feature scaling, one-hot
              encoding), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ensemble Methods:</strong> Trained and compared multiple
              models including decision trees and gradient boosting classifiers
              to find the optimal predictor
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <h3>Data Transformation</h3>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          The raw match data contained information about individual matches with
          winner and loser columns. I transformed this into a player-centric
          format where each row represents one player in a match, with features
          describing both players and their relative strengths. This
          transformation doubled the dataset size and enabled symmetric feature
          engineering.
        </p>

        <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          The Elo rating system was crucial to the model's performance. I
          implemented a version adapted for tennis that considers margin of
          victory and adjusts ratings more aggressively for unexpected outcomes.
          Additional features captured various aspects of match context:
        </p>
        <ul
          style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--text-muted)"
        >
          <li>Rank and point differences between players</li>
          <li>Age difference (experience vs. youth)</li>
          <li>Surface type (clay, grass, hard court) with one-hot encoding</li>
          <li>Tournament tier and importance</li>
          <li>Seasonality (time of year affects player form)</li>
          <li>Recent performance metrics and head-to-head records</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Model Development</h3>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          I started with a baseline model using only ATP rankings, which
          achieved 58% accuracy. After adding engineered features and training
          gradient boosting classifiers, accuracy improved to 64%. The gradient
          boosting model outperformed decision trees by better capturing
          non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
        </p>

        <h3>Pipeline Architecture</h3>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          The scikit-learn pipeline handles all preprocessing automatically:
          missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, StandardScaler
          normalizes continuous features, and OneHotEncoder converts categorical
          variables. This ensures consistent preprocessing between training and
          prediction, preventing data leakage and making the model
          production-ready.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          One major challenge was handling missing data, particularly for older
          matches where detailed statistics weren't recorded. I implemented a
          sophisticated imputation strategy that uses median values for
          numerical features and mode for categorical features, while also
          creating indicator variables to flag imputed values.
        </p>

        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          Another challenge was preventing overfitting while maintaining good
          performance. I addressed this through cross validation, careful
          feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The gradient boosting
          model uses limited tree depth and learning rate to prevent memorizing
          training examples.
        </p>

        <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          The final model achieves 64% prediction accuracy, a significant
          improvement over the 58% baseline and exceeding the 50% random guess
          threshold by a substantial margin. Feature importance analysis
          revealed that Elo ratings, rank differences, and surface type were the
          most predictive features. The model performs better on matches between
          players with larger skill gaps and struggles with close matchups,
          which aligns with intuition about tennis match dynamics.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6">
          Potential enhancements include incorporating player injury history,
          recent match fatigue, head-to-head records, and momentum indicators.
          Adding neural networks or more sophisticated ensemble methods could
          also improve performance.
        </p>
