        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan with a
            deep passion for building full-stack applications and scalable and
            fault-tolerant distributed systems. Currently working as a Software
            Engineering Co-op at Barracuda Networks, where I develop backend
            infrastructure that directly impacts product reliability and user
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey in software engineering has been driven by a fascination
            with how systems behave at scale. From implementing consensus
            algorithms like Paxos to architecting MapReduce pipelines, I enjoy
            solving complex problems that require both theoretical knowledge and
            practical implementation skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m fascinated by how distributed systems bring theory and reality
            together. Building a system that stays consistent through network
            partitions, tolerates failures, and scales effortlessly under
            pressure feels like solving a puzzle that rewards both precision and
            creativity.
          </p>

          <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
          <p>
            At Barracuda Networks, I've been focused on improving system
            reliability and performance. Recently, I've developed a
            cache-entitlement layer that reduced support escalations by 21% and
            resolved critical production issues affecting customer connectivity.
            These experiences have taught me that great engineering isn't just
            about writing code but it is also about understanding business
            impact and user needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
          <div class="interest-list">
            <li>🔧 Distributed Systems Architecture</li>
            <li>⚡ High-Performance Backend Development</li>
            <li>☁️ Cloud Infrastructure & AWS</li>
            <li>🔄 Consensus Algorithms & Fault Tolerance</li>
            <li>📊 Database Design & Optimization</li>
            <li>🚀 System Scalability & Performance</li>
          </div>

          <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not deep in distributed systems papers or debugging race
            conditions, you'll find me following ATP tennis tournaments (I even
            built a machine learning model to predict match outcomes!) and
            exploring how I can use my full stack skills to build something
            impactful. I'm also passionate about contributing to open source
            projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my main pillars is that I believe the best engineers are
            lifelong learners who stay curious, embrace challenges, and never
            stop asking "why?" and "what if?". This mindset has served me well
            and is a key driving force behind my growth as an engineer.
